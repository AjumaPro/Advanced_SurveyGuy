# ✅ Current Question Index Error Fixed

## 🚨 **Error Identified:**
```
ReferenceError: currentQuestionIndex is not defined
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
I had removed the `currentQuestionIndex` state variable during cleanup, but it was still being used in the progress bar calculation within the survey preview component.

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied:**

### **Before (Missing Variable):**
```javascript
const [previewMode, setPreviewMode] = useState('desktop');
const [isFullscreen, setIsFullscreen] = useState(false);
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('preview');

// ❌ currentQuestionIndex was removed but still used in:
// Progress bar calculation: ((currentQuestionIndex + 1) / survey.questions.length) * 100
```

### **After (Variable Restored):**
```javascript
const [currentQuestionIndex, setCurrentQuestionIndex] = useState(0);
const [previewMode, setPreviewMode] = useState('desktop');
const [isFullscreen, setIsFullscreen] = useState(false);
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('preview');
```

## 📍 **Where It Was Used:**
The variable was being used in two places for the progress bar:

1. **Progress Percentage Display:**
```javascript
<span>{Math.round(((currentQuestionIndex + 1) / survey.questions.length) * 100)}%</span>
```

2. **Progress Bar Width:**
```javascript
style={{ width: `${((currentQuestionIndex + 1) / survey.questions.length) * 100}%` }}
```

## ✅ **Result:**
- **Runtime Error**: ✅ Fixed
- **Progress Bar**: ✅ Working properly
- **State Management**: ✅ Complete
- **Functionality**: ✅ Restored

## 🎯 **Key Learning:**
When cleaning up unused variables, always check if they're referenced elsewhere in the component, especially in JSX calculations.

**The currentQuestionIndex error has been resolved!** 🎉
