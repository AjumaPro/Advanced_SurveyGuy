  // Validates before publishing
  // Updates UI state appropriately
};

// Publish function with validation
const publishSurvey = async () => {
  // Validates title, questions, and question titles
  // Shows user-friendly error messages

// Fetches only published surveys
const fetchPublishedSurveys = async () => {
  const response = await api.surveys.getSurveysByStatus(user.id, 'published');
  setSurveys(response.surveys || []);
};

// Bulk operations for multiple surveys
const handleBulkAction = async (action) => {
